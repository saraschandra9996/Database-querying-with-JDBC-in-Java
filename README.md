# Database-querying-with-JDBC-in-Java
Masters Project

Aim: We will be working with a database named "cst467" using Java and JDBC (Java
Database Connectivity). The database consists of three tables related to employee information. We will be writing Java code to perform various queries on these tables.

Step 1: Installing MYSQL Database in our system. ( Connect to that database and create sample tables with Data)
Step 2: Install JAVA and IDE(Netbeans/ Eclipse).
Step 3: Write a sample Java program to connect the database by using a JDBC connection.
Step 4: Create extensions to run the Java program while connecting with the MYSQL database.
Step 5: Run the program and check whether it is connecting to the database from the Java application.
Step 6: Finally, Check the results whether the SQL query outputs are displaying or not.
